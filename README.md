=====
A small OpenFlow project for Harvard CS143 Fall'12 Midterm Part I.

Created by Youngjune Lee Gwon.

1. Quick patch to your Mininet is necessary
   - Replace net.py and topo.py found at /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mininet-0.0.0-py2.7.egg/mininet
     of your VM with new versions found in this repository

2. sample_topo.py and sample_topo2.py explain how to create custom network topology and configure link delays

3. q7.py is a template for Q7, however, completing q7.py is optional

4. yourController.py is a simple, dumb remote controller that works only for a loop-free network of switches
